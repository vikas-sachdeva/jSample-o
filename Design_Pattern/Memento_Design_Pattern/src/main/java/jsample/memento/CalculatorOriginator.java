/**
 * 
 * Memento design pattern is one of the behavioral design pattern.
 * 
 * Memento design pattern is used when requirement is to save the state of an
 * object so that it can be restored later i.e. for providing undo or restore
 * functionality.
 * 
 * Memento pattern is used to implement this in such a way that the saved state
 * data of the object is not accessible outside of the object, this protects the
 * integrity of saved state data.
 * 
 * There are 3 participants in this design pattern -
 * 
 * 1) Originator - Originator is the object whose state needs to be saved and
 * restored. It uses Memento object for saving and restoring its internal state.
 * 
 * 2) Memento - Stores internal state of the Originator object. The state can
 * include any number of state variables. The Memento must have two interfaces -
 * one is for CareTaker and one is for Originator. CareTaker interface must not
 * allow any operations or any access to internal state stored by the Memento
 * and thus honors encapsulation. The Originator interface allows the Originator
 * to access any state variables necessary for the Originator to restore its
 * previous state.
 * 
 * 3) CareTaker - CareTaker is the helper class that is responsible for storing
 * and restoring the Originatorâ€™s state through Memento object. It is
 * responsible for keeping the Memento objects. The Memento is opaque to the
 * CareTaker, and the CareTaker must not operate on it.
